## 🧠 About Me  
I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that **learn, adapt, and create**.  
Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Computer Science (Machine Learning specialization)** at **Georgia Tech**,  
where I explore **multimodal AI**, **generative models**, and **edge-ready LLM/VLM systems**.

Previously, I worked at **Fortinet Technologies** as an **AI/ML Engineer**,  
building production-grade models for **network anomaly detection**, **automated diagnostics**, and **edge intelligence**.  

💡 I love combining **research + engineering** — from training models to deploying scalable AI pipelines.
