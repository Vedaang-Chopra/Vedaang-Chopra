Experience
Fortinet Technologies Inc. (AIOps, R&D) Bengaluru, India
Software Development Engineer I & II (ML/AI) Feb. 2021 – Jul. 2025
– Led development of an Agentic RAG chatbot (LLMs + tool calling) — a Fortinet Hackathon 2023 (5th place)
prototype that evolved into a production feature, reducing issue-resolution time by over 70%.
– Built an unsupervised connectivity-threshold model (PCT/172022/958026) to detect wireless anomalies,
cutting manual troubleshooting efforts by more than 75%.
– Implemented DBSCAN-based anomaly detection for SD-WAN telemetry, proactively preventing over 50% of
potential network outages.
– Re-architected OpenSearch ingestion pipelines using async I/O and Golang, scaling event throughput from under
50 to over 2000 events per second.
– Deployed edge-optimized ML models via ONNX Runtime, lowering inference latency by 40% across distributed
FortiGate devices.
– Automated multi-domain data collection and SLA forecasting for 60+ ML classifiers and 4 SLA categories,
enabling 7-day AI-based performance prediction.

Research & Other Technical Projects
Which–VLM Router — CS 8803 Systems for AI (Advisor: Dr. Anand Iyer) Aug. 2025 – Present
– Designing a semantic router that dynamically directs multimodal (text, vision, audio) queries across multiple
VLM/LLM endpoints using budget–aware and retrieval–augmented policies; expected to achieve 30% lower
inference cost with comparable accuracy to Mixture-of-Experts baselines such as FrugalGPT and METIS.
Edge Glass Assistant — CS 8803 VLM & LLM (Advisors: Dr. Zsolt Kira, Dr. Alan Ritter) Aug. 2025 – Present
– Building a lightweight multimodal assistant aligning vision, audio, and text embeddings through frozen encoders
and quantized projectors for on–device reasoning; aims to deliver 2× faster inference with minimal accuracy
degradation compared to existing edge–ready frameworks like PaLM-E and MovieChat.
ATHENA — CS 8903 Agentic AI (Advisor: Dr. Vijay Madisetti) Jan. 2025 – May 2025
– Developed ATHENA, a multi-agent generative AI framework unifying LLMs, diffusion models, and memory
orchestration for automated screenplay-to-video generation, outperforming prior single-agent baselines ( BLEU-4
+18%, CLIPScore +22%).
Ontology-based Text Classification — Undergraduate Research (Advisor: Dr. Sonika Malik) 2019 – 2020
– Proposed a semantic ontology framework using the Human Disease Ontology (DOID) for biomedical text
classification, improving accuracy by 10% over classical ML baselines and published in CEUR Workshop
Proceedings (Vol. 2786) .
